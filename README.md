# Flutter App with Supabase and Clean Architecture

This project is a **Flutter** application that leverages **Supabase** as the backend service. The app is designed with **Clean Architecture** principles to ensure maintainability, scalability, and a clear separation of concerns. It utilizes the **BLoC (Business Logic Component)** pattern for effective state management, providing seamless interaction between the UI and business logic.

## Features

- **Supabase Integration**: Provides database management, authentication, and real-time capabilities.
- **Clean Architecture**: Ensures clear separation of layers (presentation, domain, and data) for maintainability and scalability.
- **BLoC Pattern**: Efficient state management, keeping business logic separate from the UI.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes for a smooth user experience across devices.
- **Real-time Data**: Utilizes Supabaseâ€™s real-time features for immediate updates across the app.

## Project Structure

The project follows **Clean Architecture** principles:

- **Presentation Layer**: Contains the UI components (widgets) and BLoC files responsible for state management.
- **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic and entities.
- **Data Layer**: Manages data sources and repositories (Supabase integration).
